# Project Description

This project contains a Wordle server, client, and library used for entertainment.
The client contacts the serve for a word which the player then must guess.

# How to Compile

This project was done in python so there is no need for compiling

# How to Run the Client

usage:
python3 client.py <hostname> [port number]

How we ran it:
python3 client.py localhost

# How to Run the Server

usage:
python3 server.py [port number]

How we ran it:
python3 server.py

How to close server:
ctrl c once then wait for client to finish playing

# Library

static or shared?
We used a shared library because all imported .py files are automatically shared libraries.
They are loaded at runtime and are not compiled into our two programs.

# Known Issues

We noticed no issues throughout our testing process.

# How we worked as a team and identified the necessary tasks

We split up the work while also working together to make sure we had
a cohesive plan. We also updated eachother on progress via Discord.
